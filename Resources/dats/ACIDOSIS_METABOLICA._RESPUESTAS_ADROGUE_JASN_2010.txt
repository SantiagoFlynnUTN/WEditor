ABSTRACT 


Each 
of 
the 
four 
canonical 
acid-base 
disorders 
expresses 
as 
a 
primary 
change 
in 
carbon 
dioxide 
tension 
or 
plasma 
bicarbonate 
concentration 
followed 
by 
a 
secondary 
response 
in 
the 
countervailing 
variable. 
Quantified 
empirically, 
these 
secondary 
responses 
are 
directional 
and 
proportional 
to 
the 
primary 
changes, 
run 
a 
variable 
time 
course, 
and 
tend 
to 
minimize 
the 
impact 
on 
body 
acidity 
engendered 
by 
the 
primary 
changes. 
Absence 
of 
an 
appropriate 
secondary 
response 
denotes 
the 
coexistence 
of 
an 
additional 
acid-base 
disorder. 
Here 
we 
address 
the 
expected 
magnitude 
of 
the 
secondary 
response 
to 
each 
cardinal 
acid-base 
disorder 
in 
humans 
and 
offer 
caveats 
for 
judging 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
each 
secondary 
response.

The

include 
the 
respiratory 
disorders 
(acidosis 
and 
alkalosis) 
and 
the 
metabolic 
disorders 
(acidosis 
and

Whereas 
the 
respiratory 
disorders 
are 
expressed 
as 
primary 
changes 
in 
PaCO2, 
the 
metabolic 
disorders 
are 
expressed 
as

Each 
primary 
change 
in 
either 
the 
respiratory 
or 
the 
metabolic 
component 
elicits 
in 
vivo 
a 
secondary 
response 
in 
the 
countervailing 
component 
that 
is 
directional 
and 
proportional 
to 
the 
primary 
change, 
albeit 
fractionally 
smaller, 
thus 
tending 
to 
minimize 
the 
change 
in 
body 
acidity. 
These 
secondary 
responses 
orig


inate 
from 
physicochemical 
buffering 
and 
change 
in 
ventilation, 
organic-acid 
metabolism, 
and 
renal 
acidification. 
They 
have 
been 
quantified 
in 
dogs 
and 
humans, 
are 
consistent 
in 
presence 
and 
predictableinmagnitude,
andareviewedasan 
integral 
part 
of 
each 
canonical 
disorder. 
Absence 
of 
an 
appropriate 
secondary 
response 
denotes 
the 
coexistence 
of 
an 
additional 
acid-base 
disturbance.1–3 


A 
popular, 
alternative 
epithet 
of 
the 
secondary 
responses 
is 
compensatory. 
We 
discourage 
use 
of 
this 
term, 
because 
it 
evokes 
confusing 
pronouncements 
about 
partial 
versus 
complete 
compensation; 
secondary 
responses 
generally 
ameliorate 
the 
impact 
of 
primary 
changes 
on 
blood 
acidity 
but 
never 
completely 
restore 
blood 
acidity 
to 
control 
levels. 
Moreover, 
under 
certain 
circumstances, 
secondary 
responses 
yield 
a 
maladaptive 
effect 
on 
blood 
pH 
(see 
next 
section).1,3 
We 
term 
the 
secondary 
responses 
to 
respiratory 
acidosis 
(primary 
increase 
in 


PaCO2) 
and 
respiratory 
alkalosis 
(primary 
decrease 
in 
PaCO2) 
secondary 
hyperbicarbonatemia 
and 
secondary 
hypobicarbonatemia, 
respectively. 
The 
alternative 
terms 
secondary 
or 
compensatory 
metabolic 
alkalosis 
and 
secondary 
or 
compensatory 
metabolic 
acidosis, 
respectively, 
are 
also 
confusing 
and 
objectionable. 
Similarly, 
the 
secondary 
responses 
to 
metabolic 
acidosis 
(primary 
decrease 
in 
plasma 
[HCO3 
]) 
and 
metabolic 
alkalosis 
(primary 
increase 
in 
plasma 
[HCO3 
]) 
are 
termedsecondaryhypocapniaandsecondary 
hypercapnia, 
respectively; 
we 
discourage 
use 
of 
the 
alternative 
terms 
secondary 
or 
compensatory 
respiratory 
alkalosis 
and 
secondary 
or 
compensatory 
respiratory 
acidosis, 
respectively.3

Respiratory 
Acidosis 


Hypercapnia 
acidifies 
body 
fluids 
and 
ti-
trates 
nonbicarbonate 
buffers, 
yielding 
a 
small 
increase 
in 
plasma 
[HCO3 
]. 
This 
secondary 
hyperbicarbonatemic 
response 
is 
completed 
within 
5 
to 
10 
minutes 
and 
remains 
stable 
for 
several 
hours. 
Observations 
in 
unanesthetized 
normal 
humans 
studied 
in 
an 
environmental 
chamber 
(inspired 
CO2 
7 
and 
10%) 
reveal 
a 
mean 
[HCO3 
]/PaCO2 
slope 
of 
0.1 
mEq/L

expected 
[HCO3 
] 
. 
24 
. 
[(current 
PaCO2 
.

. 
0.1].4 
An 
essentially 
identical 
slope 
is 
obtained 
in 
humans 
in 
whom 
respiratory 
acidosis 
is 
induced 
by 
endogenous 
hypercapnia.5 


Sustained 
hypercapnia 
causes 
an 
additional, 
larger 
increase 
in 
plasma 
[HCO3 
] 
owing 
to 
stimulation 
of 
renal 
acidification. 
In 
dogs, 
a 
new 
steady 
state 
emerges 
within 
3 
to 
5 
days.6,7 
Whether 
this 
temporal 
pattern 
applies 
to 
humans 
is 
unknown. 
In 
patients, 
chronic 
hypercapnia 
often 
reflects 
gradual 
deterioration 
in 
pulmonary 
function; 
consequently, 
the 
secondary 
response 
might 
keep 
pace 
with 
the 
slowly 
rising 
PaCO2 
without 
a 
perceptible 
delay. 
Careful 
observations 
of 
patients 
with 
chronic 
hypercapnia 
as 
a 
result 
of 
chronic 
obstructive 
pulmonary 
disease 
allowed 
estimation 
of 
a 
mean 
[HCO3

slope 
of 
0.35 
mEq/L

[(current

This 
slope 
functions 
up 
to 
a 


PaCO2

approximately 
70

or

with 
various 
disorders, 
such 
as 
diarrhea, 
disturbancesofintermediarymetabolism,
orrenal

Although 
the 
magnitude 
of 
the 
ventilatory 
response 
varies 
considerably 
among 
studies, 
it 
seems 
to 
be 
independent 
of 
the 
cause 
of 
the 
acidosis. 
Compiling 
most 
published 
studies, 
a 
mean

The 
secondary 
response 
appears 
within 
30 
to 
120 
minutes 
from 
onset 
of 
metabolic 
acidosis; 
the 
time 
interval 
for 
its 
completion 
(and 
its 
disappearance 
after 
correction 
of 
the 
metabolic 
acidosis) 
depends 
on 
the 
pace 
of 
development 
of 
the 
disorder.21,22 
In 
patients 
with 
cholera, 
when 
plasma 
[HCO3 
] 
falls 
or 
corrects 
slowly, 
such 
as 
by 
6 
mEq/L 
in 
24 
hours, 
the 
ventilatory 
response 
keeps 
pace 
with 
the 
level 
of 
plasma 
[HCO3 
]. 
Conversely, 
when 
metabolic 
acidosis 
develops 
or 
corrects 
rapidly, 
11 
to 
24 
hours 
is 
required 
for 
the 
ventilatory 
response 
to 
reach 
completion 
or 
vanish.16 


Metabolic 
Alkalosis 


Contrary 
to 
the 
wide 
recognition 
of 
metabolic 
acidosis–induced 
secondary 
hypocapnia, 
the 
very 
existence 
of 
secondary 
hypercapnia 
in 
response 
to 
metabolic 
alkalosis 
is 
controversial.23,24 
Absence 
of 
hypercapnia 
in 
some 
early 
studies 
can 
be 
traced 
to 
methodologic 
problems 
and 
inclusion 
of 
patients 
who 
have 
disorders 
that 
stimulate 
ventilation.23 
In 
addition, 
confusion 
arises 
from 
the 
seemingly 
paradoxic 
stimulation 
of 
ventilation 
observed 
during 
rapid 
intravenous 
infusion 
of 
sodium 
bicarbonate, 
a 
model 
of 
acute 
metabolic 
alkalosis; 
this 
hyperventilatory 
response, 
caused 
by 
decomposition 
of 
bicarbonateintoCO2,
isshort-livedandconverts 
to 
alkalemia-induced 
hypoventilation.
25 


Subsequent 
studies 
established 
that 
the 
alkalemia 
engendered 
by 
metabolic 
alkalosis 
consistently 
suppresses 
alveolar 
ventilation, 
an 
effect 
primarily 
caused

Contrary 
to 
early 
views, 
neither 
hypoxemia 
nor 
potassium 
depletion 
prevents 
expression 
of 
this 
response. 
The 
requisite 
time 
for 
development 
of 
the 
secondary 
hypercapnia 
remains 
uncertain. 
Although 
studies 
indicate 
that 
full 
expression 
of 
the 
hypoventilatory 
response 
requires 
24 
to 
36 
hours, 
such 
a 
lag 
might 
not 
occur 
in 
patients 
who 
develop 
metabolic 
alkalosis 
at 
a 
slow 
pace. 


CAVEATS 


In 
assessing 
the 
appropriateness 
of 
the 
secondary 
response 
to 
an 
acid-base 
disorder, 
there 
are 
several 
caveats. 


Time 
Course 


As 
noted, 
considerable 
uncertainty 
exists 
regarding 
the 
time 
course 
for 
completion 
and 
eradication 
of 
the 
secondary 
responses 
in 
humans. 
A 
mixed 
acid-base 
disorder 
might 
be 
diagnosed 
incorrectly 
because 
insufficient 
time 
has 
elapsed 
for 
the 
secondary 
response 
to 
a 
single 
primary 
disorder 
to 
develop 
or 
resolve.3 


Confidence 
Intervals 


Empirical 
data 
have 
been 
used 
to 
construct 
confidence 
intervals 
that 
define 
the 
limits 
of 
the 
secondary 
response 
to 
each 
acid-base 
disorder. 
In 
clinical 
practice, 
these 
limits 
can 
be 
taken 
as 
3 
mEq/L 
for 
plasma 
[HCO3 
] 
and 
5 
mmHg 
for 
PaCO2 
from 
the 
values 
calculated 
from 
the 
mean, 
steady-state 
slopes 
(Table 
1).3 
Values 
falling 
outside 
these 
limits 
denote 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
mixed 
acidbase 
disorder. 
Importantly, 
values 
falling 
within 
the 
limits 
of 
the 
secondary 
response 
can 
be 
interpreted 
as 
consistent 
with 
but 
not 
diagnostic 
of 
a 
particular 
disorder. 
In 
fact, 
a 
given 
set 
of 
acid-base 
values 
is 
never 
diagnostic 
of 
a 
specific 
acidbase 
disorder; 
clinical 
correlation 
is 
always 
required 
to 
establish 
the 
correct 
diagnosis. 
Interpretation 
of 
acid-base 
data 
of 
patients 
undergoing 
ventilator 
sup


port 
must 
consider 
that 
this 
procedure 
sets

Impact 
of 
Preexisting 
Acid-Base 
Disorders 


Clinicians 
tend 
to 
apply 
equally 
the 
slopes 
depicted 
in 
Table 
1 
to 
patients 
presumed 
to 
have 
a 
single 
acid-base 
disorder 
and 
those 
with 
mixed 
disorders. 
This 
practice 
assumes 
preexisting 
acid-base 
disorders 
do 
not 
influence 
the 
secondary 
response 
to 
superimposed 
disorders. 
Extensive 
studies 
of 
the 
dog 
demonstrate 
this 
supposition 
is 
largely 
erroneous. 
The 
[HCO3 
]/PaCO2 
response 
to 
acute 
hypercapnia 
in 
dogs 
with 
background 
metabolic 
acidosis 
or 
chronic 
respiratory 
alkalosis 
is 
larger 
than 
that 
in 
normal 
animals, 
whereas 
this 
response 
is 
smaller 
than 
normal 
in 
dogs 
with 
preexisting 
metabolic 
alkalosis 
or 
chronic 
respiratory 
acidosis.27,28 
Similarly, 
the 
[HCO3 
]/ 


PaCO2 
response 
to 
chronic 
respiratory 
acidosis 
is 
larger 
in 
dogs 
with 
underlying 
metabolic 
acidosis 
and 
smaller 
in 
those 
with 
background 
metabolic 
alkalosis 
than 
in 
normal 
dogs.29,30 
Normal 
dogs 
and 
dogs 
with 
background

have

identical

but 
this

is 
much 
larger 
in 
dogs 
with

It 
is 
highly 
probable 
but 
still 
unknown 
whether 
humans 
exhibit 
a 
similar 
response 
to 
that 
demonstrated 
in 
dogs. 
Consequently, 
the 
direct 
applicability 
of 
the 
slopes 
depicted 
in 
Table 
1 
to 
patients 
with 
mixed 
acid-base 
disorders 
is 
uncertain. 


Hybrid 
Nature 
of 
Plasma 
[HCO3

in 
Metabolic 
Disorders 


It 
is 
generally 
assumed 
that 
changes 
in 
PaCO2 
that 
attend 
metabolic 
disorders 
have 
no 
impact 
on 
plasma 
[HCO3 
] 
other 
than 
the 
small 
change 
occurring 
as 
a 
consequence 
of 
buffering; 
however, 
this 
formulation 
assumes 
that 
the 
kidney 
has 
a 
way 
to 
discriminate 
between 
primary 
and 
secondary 
changes 
in 
PaCO2, 
mounting 
a 
vigorous 
acidification 
response 
to 
the 
former, 
as 
reflected 
in 
the 
[HCO3 
]/PaCO2 
slopes 
of 
chronic 
respiratory 
alkalosis 
and 
chronic 
respiratory 
acidosis 
(Table 
1) 
but 
remaining 
indifferent 
to 
the 
latter. 
This 
formulation 
proves 
fallacious 
in 
studies 
of 
dogs 
with 
metabolic 
acidosis 
or 
metabolic 
alkalosis, 
in 
which 
the 
kidney 
elicits 
major 
acidification 
responses 
to 
the 
prevailing
